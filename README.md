# Field Service Security Systems Simulator

This project simulates a field service management system for security engineers and coordinators handling technical security system requests, field dispatch, and site documentation. It was inspired by real operational responsibilities in corporate and industrial security environments.

## Goals

- Simulate intake and management of service issues within SLA
- Review and dispatch work to field engineers with initial troubleshooting
- Generate field instructions and remediation directions
- Provide audit templates and track site documentation
- Identify process improvement insights

## Key Features

- CSV-based intake of service tickets
- Python tool to dispatch issues and flag those missing pre-checks
- Markdown-based audit and transfer templates
- Sample configurations for low voltage/security systems

## Structure

- `data/`: Simulated requests, system history, and documentation logs
- `scripts/`: Tools to generate performance summaries and dispatch guidance
- `docs/`: Audit and transfer templates used during commissioning
- `configs/`: Sample configuration from field systems

## Technologies

- Python
- Markdown
- CSV for data storage

## Use Case Example

1. Service request is logged in `service_requests.csv`
2. `dispatch_tool.py` identifies incomplete pre-dispatch checks
3. Field engineer instructions are generated
4. After work, audit and transfer templates are filled
5. `performance_summary.py` gives SLA compliance stats

## Status

This project is a learning simulation for physical security and field service operations.
