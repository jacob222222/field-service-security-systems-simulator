# Field Service Security Systems Simulator

This project simulates a real-world field service management system tailored for security engineers and service coordinators. It models the intake, triage, and dispatch of technical security system issues â€” including SLA tracking, field engineer guidance, audit documentation, and system commissioning. Inspired by real operational workflows in corporate, manufacturing, and industrial security environments, this simulation showcases my ability to design, maintain, and optimize complex physical security support systems.

## Goals

- Simulate intake and management of service issues within SLA
- Review and dispatch work to field engineers with initial troubleshooting
- Generate field instructions and remediation directions
- Provide audit templates and track site documentation
- Identify process improvement insights

## Key Features

- CSV-based intake of service tickets
- Python tool to dispatch issues and flag those missing pre-checks
- Markdown-based audit and transfer templates
- Sample configurations for low voltage/security systems

## Structure

- `data/`: Simulated requests, system history, and documentation logs
- `scripts/`: Tools to generate performance summaries and dispatch guidance
- `docs/`: Audit and transfer templates used during commissioning
- `configs/`: Sample configuration from field systems

## Technologies

- Python
- Markdown
- CSV for data storage

## Use Case Example

1. Service request is logged in `service_requests.csv`
2. `dispatch_tool.py` identifies incomplete pre-dispatch checks
3. Field engineer instructions are generated
4. After work, audit and transfer templates are filled
5. `performance_summary.py` gives SLA compliance stats

## Status

This project is a learning simulation for physical security and field service operations.
